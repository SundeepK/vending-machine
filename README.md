# VendingMachine

A simple vending machine to learn more about ruby. It's not perfect as I'm still going along the language to learn more.

## Requirements
Ruby (2.5.0p0), Bundler


## Install
Run:
```bash
    $ bundle install
```

## Test
Run:
```bash
    $ rake spec
```

## Vending machine
Run:
```bash
    $ ./bin/vending_machine
```
You can also build and install the gem and then run the `vending_machine` from command line.

This will launch a simple console app where you can select options to list, buy top up product stock or change.
